## About

### Purpose
This is a Command Line Interface application designed to allow users to check damage calculations between Pokemon. The goal was to enable as much customization as possible, while maintaining accuracy. This was the first project I developed on my own, and as such served as a massive stepping stone to the work I do today.

### Context
I've been a Pokemon enjoyer since I was young - once I learned how primitive data types worked, I realized I technically had ALL the tools I needed to create such a thing. This project was literally the first personal project I made, and as a result is a little unrefined. This project began before I learned what an Object even was, let alone DataBases or APIs. The entire accessible list of moves and Pokemon were hand written by me to .txt files!

The idea has since been reworked into a more accurate, powerful, and user-friendly application. That project can be found [here](https://github.com/ktstevick/ktstevick/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/websites/PKMN%20Calc%20App) if you're interested. I really enjoyed learning about programming and project management with a system I was already fairly familiar with, and hope to expand this project at some point in the future.

## Installation

Download and open via IDE

## Future Plans
- enhanced interface (actual graphics)
- RDBMs and/or API integration

## Technical Details

### Notes
1.  The automated tests are underdeveloped (I barely understood the concept at the time) so most adjustments were done by testing manually
