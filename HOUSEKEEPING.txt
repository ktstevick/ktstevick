HOUSEKEEPING -

1/22/24

This is more of a personal note to help me keep track of this repo and organize my own thoughts/projects.

Looks like we're in there. It seems to be authenticating through my browser at the moment, which isn't a huge deal.

I'll have to provide Terminal with the access code at some point, but that's hardly a priority.

Now, I'm going to add a personal project with no git history.

So far so good. Porting over other projects first, then moving to the next stage.

I'll HAVE to go back and tidy up some of these projects of course (some comments are a little unnecessary, to say the least), but right now I'm just trying to establish board presence.
