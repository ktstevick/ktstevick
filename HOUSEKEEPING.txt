HOUSEKEEPING -

This is more of a personal note to help me keep track of this repo and organize my own thoughts/projects.

Looks like we're in there. It seems to be authenticating through my browser at the moment, which isn't a huge deal.

I'll have to provide Terminal with the access code at some point, but that's hardly a priority.

Now, I'm going to add a personal project with no git history.
