## About

### Purpose
```
Congratulationsâ€”you've landed a job with TEnmo, whose product is an online payment service for transferring "TE bucks" between friends. However, they don't have a product yet. You've been tasked with writing a RESTful API server and command-line application.
```

### Context
Our second Capstone - this one was a beast at the time. My teammate was sick and absent for most of the project, so the lion's share of this project was my work. This project is my first RESTful API, and it allows authenticated users to receive and send payments, funds, and other transactions akin to another popular banking app. This, however, is a Command Line Interface. I actually had a lot of fun with this project and learned a massive amount about APIs, authenticated users, Relational Database Managament Systems, and even the UI/UX of a CLI.

## Installation

Download and run the seed script for the Database first, then start the Server and run the Client.

## Notes
1.  Probably the sharpest learning curve of any project so far. I had to juggle SQL, Java, the Client-Server model, and Peer Programming, all of which I had only just been introduced to a few weeks earlier. All in all I'm very happy with how it turned out.
