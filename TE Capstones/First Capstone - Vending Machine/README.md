# Module 1 Capstone - Vending Machine Software
![COVER IMAGE](https://i.imgur.com/BXjJHIs.png)

## About

### Purpose
```
You're developing an application for the newest vending machine distributor,
Umbrella Corp. They've released a new vending machine, Vendo-Matic 800, that's integrated
with everyone's bank accounts, allowing customers to purchase products from their computers for their convenience.
```

### Context
This was the Capstone project at the end of our very first module. It was my first introduction to pair programming, and although fairly rudimentary, this project was a great opportunity to learn. This is a Command Line Interface that simulates a vending machine, including changing inventories, price adjustment, logging, and even a touch of future proofing.

## Installation

Download and open via IDE

## Notes
1.  Original README detailing project requirements is not included here (it's proprietary), but I assure you: my team and I passed with flying colors.
