# KT Stevick

## About

My name is KT Stevick - I'm a software developer and artist originally from the Chicago area. I'm gonna talk more about myself soon. My repositories are listed below.

## ktstevick
```
This is the main repository I work from and like to present. It includes my formal Tech Elevator capstones and team projects, as well as all of my personal projects. Currently, the other repos are all various forms of website deployment, the proper code for which can be accessed here.

### Personal Projects
This folder contains all of the projects I've made purely for fun. I've been working 40+ hours a week, and spend the majority of my free time learning about and working on these kinds of things. Since they're personal projects, they're a little more verbose in the comments than I'd like, but otherwise accurately represent the organization, quality, and consistency I'd strive for in production code. There are several Java projects that need to be run via IDE, and a few full-stack web apps that can be run internally or viewed through a browser.

- [**Fruit Engine**](https://github.com/ktstevick/ktstevick/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/Fruit%20Engine) - Simple game engine that serves as the foundation of future projects
- [**PKMN Damage Calculator**](https://github.com/ktstevick/ktstevick/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/PKMN%20Damage%20Calculator) - Java CLI that allows users to check various Pokemon damage calculations
- [**Revisited Challenges**](https://github.com/ktstevick/ktstevick/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/Revisited%20Challenges) - Java CLI of problems from technical interviews I felt challenged by, couldn't solve within the allotted time, and/or felt like digging into deeper
- [**websites**](https://github.com/ktstevick/ktstevick/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/websites)
    - [**KTStevick Portfolio**](https://github.com/ktstevick/ktstevick/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/websites/KTStevick%20Portfolio) - Primary portfolio project, viewable [here](https://ktstevick.com)
    - [**PKMN Calc App**](https://github.com/ktstevick/ktstevick/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/websites/PKMN%20Calc%20App) - A user-friendly web-app in the same spirit as [PKMN Damage Calculator](https://github.com/ktstevick/ktstevick/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/PKMN%20Damage%20Calculator), viewable [here](https://ktstevick.github.io/test-site/)
    - [**TestName**](https://github.com/ktstevick/ktstevick/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/websites/TestName) - This is just a shell. The projects I host via GitHub Pages are stored here (see above)

### TE Capstones
Tech Elevator as a bootcamp prides itself on 800+ hours of work and condensing the last two years of a Computer Science degree into a nine month program. I completed mine in **three**. At the end of each Module, there was a major team project to demonstrate what was learned. The first module focused on Java alone, the second incorporated RDBMSs and RESTful APIs, and the final capstone doubled the team size, implemented front-end (Vue 3) code, and added a Product Owner and Scrum Master with whom I had to coordinate.

I'm very grateful for these projects and learned more than I can say from each one of them. I don't believe any of these illustrate the level of code I work at now (the Third Capstone was made in December '23) but I feel as though they are great demonstrations of my learning process, larger architectural ambitions, and ability to work with a team.

- [**First Capstone**](https://github.com/ktstevick/ktstevick/tree/main/TE%20Capstones/First%20Capstone%20-%20Vending%20Machine) - **Vending Machine;** first team project, simulated a generic vending machine's software
- [**Second Capstone**](https://github.com/ktstevick/ktstevick/tree/main/TE%20Capstones/Second%20Capstone%20-%20Banking%20App%20and%20API) - **TEnmo App;** teammate was sick, programmed mostly solo, emulates Venmo and is my first official RESTful API implementation
- [**Third Capstone**](https://github.com/ktstevick/ktstevick/tree/main/TE%20Capstones/Third%20Capstone%20-%20Plants%20Website%20and%20API) - **Plants App;** was part of a small team of developers who worked closely with a Product Owner and Scrum Master over two weeks, Agile development cycle, accomplished MVP in ten days
