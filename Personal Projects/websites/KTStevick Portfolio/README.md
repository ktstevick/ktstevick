## About

### Purpose
Portfolio sites are pretty straightforward concepts - *this one* is mine. Within you will find the art I'm currently working on, recently finished projects, formal series, and a short description of software projects to date. 

### Context
I actually have the old HTML files of my very FIRST website, coded back in 2015 my freshman year of college. This is a revisitation of the same idea, made before most of the other projects in this repository. During my Computer Science studies, I spent a lot of time developing custom components for my projects - here, I wanted to demonstrate my ability to utilize **third party components** as well as **third party API calls**. These appear in the form of the [Carousel Components](https://ismail9k.github.io/vue3-carousel/) (both large and small) and the [Dad Joke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) button on the software page.
