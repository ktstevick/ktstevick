# Revisited Challenges

## About

### Purpose
This is a Command Line Interface application designed to further explore the ideas and concepts I've been challenged by during technical interviews / code evaluations. I don't have access to the original unit tests and so will be confirming manually. In addition, I rarely have exact copies of the problems, so they are recreated to the best of my memory. The problems are organized into individual methods of the Main class, and then run accordingly.

### Context
Just because I failed some sort of exam or technical interview doesn't mean I can't still learn from it! Besides, these kinds of problems are often deliberately crafted and curated challenges. As such, they're some of the most fun to dig in to - without the pressure of a *timer*, anyways.

## Installation

Download and open via IDE

## Navigation
```
Main - This project consists of a single class with all the problems. Run from Main to check results
```

## Future Plans
- adding interview questions as I receive them
- automated testing (currently manual)

## Technical Details

### Notes
1. This project serves more as a personal notebook, and as such is significantly more verbose than the rest of my coding projects.

### Version Differences
```
Version 0.9.0 - Base state, no changes
```
